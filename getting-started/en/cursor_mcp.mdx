## 1. Preparation (Prerequisite)

- Node.js: higher or equal to version 16
- CURSOR IDE: Uptodate version (above 0.47.8 recommended)

Check if these are already installed.

```bash
node --version

npm --version
```

## 2. Install MCP at Terminal

Set up the MCP server by installing the command provided below. It is only necessary the first time.

```bash
npx mint-mcp add argosidentity
```

Then it will ask which platform you would like to install.
