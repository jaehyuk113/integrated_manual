title: AML Results
description: This event is triggered when the results of an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) screening are confirmed. AML screening is a critical component of the KYC process, assessing potential risks of financial crimes. This webhook enables you to receive AML screening results in real-time and take immediate action as needed.
---

<Note>AML screening is performed only after KYC approval. AML screening proceeds exclusively when the KYC has been approved, and the results are returned along with the submission information. If the KYC is rejected, AML screening will not be conducted.</Note>
