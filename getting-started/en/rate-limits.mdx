## api Limits

To ensure optimal performance and fair usage of our services, we enforce the following API rate limits:

Request Rate Limits
Per-Second Limit:

5,000 requests/second
Each API key can make up to 5,000 requests per second across all endpoints.
Daily Limit:

100,000 requests/day
Each API key is allowed a maximum of 100,000 requests in a 24-hour period.
Rate Limiting Details
Rate limits are applied globally across all endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE).
If the limit is exceeded, the API will return a 429 Too Many Requests response, with a Retry-After header indicating when you can retry.
