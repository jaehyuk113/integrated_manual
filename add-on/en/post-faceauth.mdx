title: 'POST/Faceauth'
description: 'The submitted FaceAuth facial image is compared with the image obtained during the previous ID Check. If a selfie image was submitted during the ID Check, it is compared with the FaceAuth image. If no selfie image was submitted, the comparison is made against the ID card image.'
---
<Warning>
**Notes**
- The authentication result is determined based on option settings and threshold values, returning either `approved` or `rejected`.
- Recommended faceImage specifications: `960 x 720`
- How to check `submissionId`:
Log in to the dashboard, go to `Settings` > `Liveform URL`, and complete the ID Check process. Once ID Check is approved, you can find the `submissionId` data in the `User Management` menu > `Submission List` in the dashboard.
  - The final status of the ID Check **must be** `approved`.
- **API Key Information**:
  A separate API Key is required from the existing liveform API Key.
  You can check your Add-on API Key under [Getting Started](/add-on/en/overview#api-3).
