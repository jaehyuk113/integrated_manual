## 1. Customizable Query String Options in Dashboard

The dashboard allows you to set the values of the parameter keys. After the KYC process is complete and the submitter selects the "Ok" button, the page will redirect to the Dynamic Fields parameters with the Return URL. The final return URL will be same to the URL of the "Ok" button when it is connected.
