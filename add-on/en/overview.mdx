description: "Add-on feature enables additional authentication for approved submissions in customer projects. 
Currently, FaceAuth (facial authentication) is supported, and future updates will introduce additional verification methods such as identity documents, official papers, and certificates.
FaceAuth enhances identity verification by comparing the facial image extracted from the submitted ID during the ID Check process with the user's submitted facial image.
