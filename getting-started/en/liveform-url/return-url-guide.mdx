## 1. Set Return URL Option in Dashboard

The dashboard allows you to set the values of the parameter keys. After the KYC process is complete and the submitter selects the "Ok" button or waits 5 seconds, the page will redirect to the Dynamic Fields parameters with the Return URL. The final return URL will be same to the URL of the "Ok" button when it is connected.

</ResponseField>

### 2-2. Encrypted option applied

Encryption is enabled when the “encrypted” parameter is included in the final return URL. AES-256-ECB is required to decrypt the value. Please consult [this guide section](https://developers.argosidentity.com/getting-started/en/encrypt-and-decrypt-data/overview#3-3-api-data-decryption-aes-256-ecb) for further information.

By using this guide, you can effectively return URL with Query String in ID check to optimize your KYC process and enhance user experience.
