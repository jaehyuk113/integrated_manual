## 3. Activate Encryption Option for Secure Data Transfer

ARGOS Identity provides an encryption option to protect sensitive KYC data transmitted through webhooks. When this feature is activated, all webhook data is automatically encrypted, enabling more secure information exchange.

### a. What does encrypted webhook data look like?

Encrypted webhook responses are delivered in the following format:`{ "data": "encrypted-string" }`, where encrypted-string is the result of encrypting the original data.

```json data-encrpyted.json
{
  "response": {
    "body": "encrypted-string"
  }
}
```

Here, encrypted-string is the result of encrypting the original data.

### b. Easily Set Up the Encryption Option
