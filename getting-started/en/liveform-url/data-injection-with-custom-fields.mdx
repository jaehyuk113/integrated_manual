mode: "default"
title: "Data Injection"
description: "Data Injection is a method to update information for an existing submission via a separate path. This process replaces existing category data with new information."
---

## 1. Prerequisites

<Note>
  To perform an Injection, a submission must first be created via Liveform.
</Note>

## 2. Query String Options (Injection)

Additional information sent via Query Strings is included in the response data when calling the API. This enables the following functionalities:

- Generation of a unique user ID for KYC submitter identification.
- Addition of up to three custom fields.

## 3. Implementation Method

Query String options can be applied using the ARGOS ID Check Liveform. All Query String values must be URL-encoded.

## 4. URL Structure

- Basic Form URL: `https://form.argosidentity.com/?pid={project_Id}`
- Injection URL: `https://form.argosidentity.com/?pid={project_id}&action=addveri&sid={submission_id}`
- Injection URL with encryption: `https://form.argosidentity.com/?pid={project_id}&encrypted={encrypted_values}`

<Warning>
  **The Injection URL with encryption** method are required to encrypt the sid and action parameters.Â 

  https://form.argosidentity.com/?pid={project_id}&encrypted={encrypted_values} (O)

  https://form.argosidentity.com/?pid={project_id}&action=addveri&sid={submission_id}&encrypted={encrytped_values} (X)
</Warning>

<Note>
  Please refer to this [link](https://developers.argosidentity.com/getting-started/en/encrypt-and-decrypt-data/overview) for encryption methods.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="cf2" type="string">
  **Must be encrypted.** Custom option field #2.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="cf3" type="string">

  **Must be encrypted.** Set the risk for IP-based routing services. As of now, `vpn` ,`proxy` and `tor` parameters are supported. There is no space between the comma and the option name in each option. This option is paired with the `ipRiskDurationHours` option.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ipRiskDurationHours" type="int">
  **Must be encrypted.** If the system detects risk, set the hour and how many hours to restrict. If `ipRiskCategory` is set without `ipRiskDurationHours`, the default value (48 hours) will be set.

<ResponseField name="distanceCheckSource" type="string">
  **Must be encrypted.** The option to prevent users from continuing if their address is distant from their IP. Currently, `ipgeo` is only avaiable. This option is paired with the `distanceMaxDistanceKm`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="distanceMaxDistanceKm" type="int">
  **Must be encrypted.** Can set a distance between the entered address and the IP-based address. If `distanceCheckSource` is set without `distanceMaxDistanceKm`, the default value (5 km) will be set.
</ResponseField>
