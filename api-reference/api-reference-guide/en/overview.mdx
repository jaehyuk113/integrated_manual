## HTTP Response Status Codes

HTTP response codes are used to indicate the status of a request. Each code represents the result of the request, following these rules:

- `2xx`: Successful request
- `4xx`: Client error
- `5xx`: Server error

| HTTP Status Code | Message                             | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200`            | OK                                  | The request was successfully processed.                                                                 |
| `400`            | Invalid Query String Parameters     | Required parameters are missing or incorrectly formatted. Verify your request parameters.               |
| `403`            | User Not Authorized (Explicit Deny) | Access denied. The IP address is not on the whitelist.                                                  |
| `403`            | Forbidden                           | Access denied. The API key used may be incorrect.                                                       |
| `413`            | Request Entity Too Large            | The request contains data exceeding the server's limits. Reduce the size and try again.                 |
| `500`            | Internal Server Error               | A server error occurred. Contact the ARGOS team if the problem persists.                                |
| `502`            | Bad Gateway                         | The server received an invalid response from the upstream server. Retry later or contact ARGOS support. |
