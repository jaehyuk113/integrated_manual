title: 'GET/Submission/applicantId'
description: 'Use this API to retrieve unique identifiers (`submission_id`) and email addresses of duplicated KYC submissions. Duplications are determined by matching name, date of birth, nationality, gender, and facial data.'
---

<Warning>
**Notes**
- `applicant_id` is generated by comparing five data points: name, date of birth, gender, nationality, and selfie.
- If no duplicates exist, only a single approved `submission` will be returned.
- Ensure the `applicant_id` is first obtained using the `GET/submission` API.
- If there is no comparable data, a random `applicant_id` is generated.
</Warning>
